    <p class="ad">Nike, Inc. is an iconic global brand that has been at the forefront of the sports and athletic footwear industry since its inception. Founded on January 25, 1964, as Blue Ribbon Sports by Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight, the company officially became Nike, Inc. on May 30, 1971.</p>
    <p class="ad">Our journey began with a commitment to innovation and performance, and we've consistently delivered on that promise. Nike has a rich history of developing cutting-edge sports equipment and high-quality athletic footwear and apparel. We have supported countless athletes, from amateurs to world-class professionals, helping them achieve their full potential.</p>

    <p class="ad">Our mission is clear and unwavering: to bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world. We firmly believe that, as our co-founder Bill Bowerman famously stated, "If you have a body, you are an athlete." We're dedicated to helping every individual, no matter their age, ability, or location, access the tools and products they need to reach their athletic and personal goals.</p>
    <p class="ad">At Nike, we embrace the transformative power of sport to create positive change.
